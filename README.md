 The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.
 
 This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also allow you to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: ```static variables```.

# Static Variables

 ```c
 static datatype variable_name = value;
 ```
 * **datatype:** the datatype of variable like int, char, float etc.
 * **variable_name:** this is the name of variable given by user.
 * **value:** any value to initialize the variable. By default, it is zero.
